EASI Gov has asked for a new website design for Erisa Trust Company. The main focus of ETC 
is around Flexible Spending Accounts and Health Savings Accounts, or FSAs and HSAs.

There are two existing sites for ETC

erisa-trust.com 

erisatrust.com  <-- we want to use this domain

Personality: trustworthy, serious, semi-upbeat and family-oriented
Think money, investments, health, financial security, tax-free savings, etc. 
CLEAN AND PROFESSIONAL, BRIGHT, SHOULD MAKE USER FEEL WELL-TAKEN-CARE OF. "We've got your back" vibes. 

Tori says he thinks erisa-trust is kind of clouded-over, overcast, gloomy lookin. The layout itself is 
well-liked; maybe go off of this general style. 
Semantically, it could be better. I think the home page should answer the most common, important questions 
our website users may have about Erisa Trust. 

As for the erisatrust site, it makes more sense content-wise right off the bat, though it can be trimmed down 
a bit. We also want to go for a more unique look and color scheme; we should set ourselves apart from the other 
HSA company websites out there. Examples:
    https://www.hsabank.com/hsabank/homepage 
    https://livelyme.com/ 
    https://healthequity.com/learn/hsa/ 
    
The EASI green tree logo will stay, so color scheme should work around it.

Key questions to answer at first glance:

1. What is an HSA?
2. Why should I open an HSA?
3. How do I qualify for an HSA?
4. How much does this cost?
