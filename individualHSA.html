        <h3 class="subheading">What is an HSA?</h3>
        <p>
          HSAs, or Health Savings Accounts, are a way for you to set aside money
          tax-free for your health expenses. There is no tax on money you put
          into your account or take out of your account, so long as you use the
          funds to pay for eligible health expenses. Qualified healthcare
          expenses can be diverse and comprehensive.

          You can also invest your HSA to help it grow over time, also tax-free.
          Erisa offers investment choices that have been professionally
          selected. There's also the option to set up a brokerage account.
        </p>
        <p>
          Money you put into your HSA stays with you, even if you change jobs.
          And unlike an FSA, your HSA funds will rollover from year to year
          until you use them, and can be used to pay for medical expenses even
          in retirement.
        </p>
        <p>
          HSAs are associated with High Deductible Health Plans (HDHP). You must
          have an HDHP through your employer, your spouse, or one you've
          purchased on your own that qualifies for an HSA. If so, you can open
          an HSA.

          How do I know if I have a High deductible Health Plan?
        </h3>
        <p>
          If your current insurance plan has a higher deductible than a
          traditional insurance plan, you probably have an High Deductible
          Health Plan (HDHP). The monthly premium is usually lower, but you pay
          more health care costs yourself before the insurance company starts to
          pay its share (your deductible). A HDHP can be combined with a health
          savings account (HSA), allowing you to pay for certain medical
          expenses with money free from federal taxes.
        </p>
        <p>
          For 2020, the IRS defines a high deductible health plan as any plan
          with a deductible of at least $1,400 for an individual or $2,800 for a
          family. An HDHP's total yearly out-of-pocket expenses (including
          deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance) can't be more than $6,900
          for an individual or $13,800 for a family. (This limit doesn't apply
          to out-of-network services.)

        <h3 class="subheading">What makes an HSA different?</h3>
        <p>
          An HSA can act like a retirement fund, much like an IRA, letting you
          put aside money for retirement instead of the “use-it-or-lose-it”
          option of the FSA. But it can also be used to pay for medical expenses
          when you need them, like an FSA or HRA, with no minimum limit or fees
          on your withdrawals.
